Netabc.tcl is a user interface for creating web pages that display the contents
of abc music notation files using Jef Moine's  

<a href="https://chiselapp.com/user/moinejf/repository/abc2svg/doc/trunk/README.md">Abc2svg</a>
JavaScript library.
Every browser whether it is on a desktop, cellphone or tablet
has a JavaScript engine that can render this music. Since the
music notation displays and plays on your browser, you no
longer need external applications such as a PostScript or Pdf
viewer or even a midi player.

<p>
The program is a tcl/tk script so it requires tcl/tk 8.5
 or 8.6 to be installed on your system.  Windows users can avoid
installing tcl/tk on Windows, by running the netabc.exe executable
which contains the tcl/tk interpreter. Otherwise you can get
tcl/tk  for free from
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/tcl/downloads/">www.activestate.com</a>.

<p>
Using netabc, you  open an abc music notation file, select
one of the tunes, and render it in common music notation
in your browser and play the contents. Netabc.tcl creates an html
file containing this tune and links it to the
JavaScript library. The temporary html file is then loaded into
your browser.  The browser executes the JavaScript and replaces
the abc notation by scaleable vector graphics (svg). This graphics
displays the tune in common music notation. If you click on one of the
displayed notes, the browser will play the music and follow
along. The generated html file is stored on your
computer, allowing you to view or edit it.

<p>
Though it is possible to create such web pages with just an
ordinary text editor,  this is not 
a trivial task.  Netabc provides several different methods for
embedding the abc file. It allows you to experiment with the different
formatting options. Different MIDI musical instruments can
be assigned to the various voices.
