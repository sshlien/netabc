<p> netabc.zip and netabc.exe were updated on February 06 2022.
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Netabc.tcl is a user interface for creating web pages that display the contents
of abc music notation files using Jef Moine's  

<a href="https://chiselapp.com/user/moinejf/repository/abc2svg/doc/trunk/README.md">Abc2svg</a>
JavaScript library.
Every browser whether it is on a desktop, cellphone or tablet
has a JavaScript engine that can render this music. Since the
music notation displays and plays on your browser, you no
longer need external applications such as a PostScript or Pdf
viewer or even a midi player.

<p>
The program is a tcl/tk script so it requires tcl/tk 8.5
 or 8.6 to be installed on your system.  Windows users can avoid
installing tcl/tk on Windows, by running the netabc.exe executable
which contains the tcl/tk interpreter. Otherwise you can get
tcl/tk  for free from
<a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/tcl/downloads/">www.activestate.com</a>.

<p>
Using netabc, you  open an abc music notation file, select
one of the tunes, and render it in common music notation
in your browser and play the contents. Netabc.tcl creates an html
file containing this tune and links it to the
JavaScript library. The temporary html file is then loaded into
your browser.  The browser executes the JavaScript and replaces
the abc notation by scaleable vector graphics (svg). This graphics
displays the tune in common music notation. If you click on one of the
displayed notes, the browser will play the music and follow
along. The generated html file is stored on your
computer, allowing you to view or edit it.

<p>
Though it is possible to create such web pages with just an
ordinary text editor,  this is not 
a trivial task.  Netabc provides several different methods for
embedding the abc file. It allows you to experiment with the different
formatting options. Different MIDI musical instruments can
be assigned to the various voices.

<h3>Download </h3>

If you have tcl/tk 8.5 or 8.6 on your system, download
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/netabc/files/netabc.zip">netabc.zip </a> and extract netabc.tcl.
If you do not have tcl/tk but you are running on the Windows
operating system, then download
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/netabc/files/netabc.exe">netabc.exe </a> .
<p>
It is recommended that you make a folder called netabc and
put one or both of these files inside that folder. 
This folder will be used to store various files that save
the state of netabc as well as the temporary html output file.
<p>
The program links to the abc2svg JavaScript library on Jef
Moine's web site; however, if you have a local copy of this library
on your system, the program can be configured to go to your local
library. The archive 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/netabc/files/js.zip">js.zip </a>
contains the main files that you need.
<p>
This archive becomes outdated very rapidly, since
Jef Moine creates a new version of this library almost every day.
You can find this on his 
<a href="https://chiselapp.com/user/moinejf/repository/abc2svg/timeline">repository</a>.  
Before you can use this library it is necessary to build it. See
the <a href="https://chiselapp.com/user/moinejf/repository/abc2svg/doc/trunk/README.md">readme.md</a> for more instructions.
Guido Gonzato posts a built library on his web site,
<a href="http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#abc2svg">abcplus.sourceforge.net</a>
which he updates frequently.

<p>
Netabc contains various other convenient features. (1) To prevent
overloading abc2svg with a large file, netabc forwards only the
selected portion of the file.  (2) When tempo, formatting or
MIDI parameters are missing, netabc allows you to embed your
own parameters into the abc notation.

<h3>Initial Configuration</h3>
<p>
On running netabc.tcl for the first time, the program will determine
which platform it is running (Windows or Linux) and set itself appropriately.
You should check this setup by clicking on the top <b>Configure</b> button.
The following image shows how the configuration window may look
on your system.
<p>
<img src = "cfg.gif" alt = "cfg">
<p>
The important setup up parameters are in the lower half of the
window, starting with the radio buttons <b>remote javascript</b>
and <b>local javascript</b>. By default remote javascript is ticked,
which tells the generated web page to load the javascript
code from Jef Moine's web site.
<p>
If you are running on Windows, the program will assume that you have
the Microsoft Edge browser or the Google Chrome browser. If neither
of these browsers are present, then you need to specify the path to
a suitable substitute.  Either type this into the entry box
or use the <b>select browser</b> to find the browser executable
on your system. On Linux, the program will attempt to connect
with the Firefox browser.
<p>
Similarly, you need to specify the path to your text editor,
to allow you to view contents of the html file. Notepad.exe is
the text editor that comes with Windows.
<p>
By default, netabc records its html output in a file called
tune.html; however, you can change its name and path.
Note that the full path name should be given, especially 
for the Windows operating system.
<p>
If you decide to download the abc2svg javascript library to
your computer and wish to link to a local version of the library,
then you should tick the <b>local javascript</b> radio button
and indicate the path to the library in the appropriate
entry box. (If you are using the folder browser, note that
you must be inside this folder and see the Scc1t2 subfolder
before clicking on the select button.) 
<p>
Abcweb can run with one of the 2 web interfaces, abcweb-1.js or
abcweb1-1.js described in Jef's readme file. Abcweb1-1.js was
designed to allow the user the choice of a particular tune from a
selection of tunes. Either interface is fine to use.

<p>
Certain symbols such as &lt &gt and &amp may occur in the
abc notation are also html control characters.
In order to avoid these issues, you can enclose the abc
notation into one of two structures rather than leaving
it in the unprotected state (plain). Netabc allows you
to choose any one of the two methods. <b>Script vnd</b> looks
a little cleaner. Do not select <b>plain</b> unless you
know those control characters will never be present in
your abc file.
<p>
The configuration information is stored in the
in the netabc.ini, so you only need to do this only once.
At this point you are ready to use netabc.tcl


<p>
Abc2svg can now play guitar chord indications to a limited extent.
To use this feature, tick the <b>Play gchords</b> check box.
Unlike abc2midi, the indicated chord is played once and
continuously until the next guitar chord indication is encountered.

<p>
Many abc notation music collections do not specify any tempo
using the Q: field command. By default the music will be played
at 120 quarter notes per minute. You can change the tempo using
the at the bottom of the configuration frame. The size of a beat
is typically 1/4 note, but for some key signatures it may be
appropriate to use a different beat size such as 1/2 note. The 
combobox at the left allows you to change the beat size.

<p>
When the music indicates the tempo, netabc will not alter
it unless you tick the checkbox labeled <b>replace tempo</b>.
All tempo markings will be changed to the value specified by
the slider and combobox. This does not change the input abc file.


<p>
<h3> Usage </h3>
<p>
You should have  proper abc files having
X:, T: and K: fields for every tune. Sample collections can be found
on my web site <a href="https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/kern2abc/">https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/kern2abc/</a>.
Load an input abc file using the top <b> file </b> button.
After loading your input abc file, a table
of contents (TOC) listing all the tunes in the file will appear.
<p>
<img src = "toc.gif" alt = "Table of Contents">
<p>
Select one of the tunes and press the <b>Render</b>
button and hopefully your browser should display the
common music notation. Clicking on one of the notes should
start the browser to play the music. The <b>Source</b>
button will show the html file in a text editor.
If you wish to see the svg representation, you
will need to tell your browser to save this to a file.
<p>
<h3> More Configurations </h3>
<p>
In some circumstances, you may wish to set the formatting parameters
so that they apply to all the tunes in a collection. If the collection
consists of string quartets, you may wish to assign the MIDI instruments
corresponding to the different voices to specific string instruments.
If you place these settings before the first X: reference statement,
then they will apply to the entire file. This is called the header
of the abc notation file. Few abc collection files make use of this
feature, so you can create such a header inside netabc which will
accomplish the same thing. You can tell netabc, whether to use the
header in the file, or the internal representation by ticking the
appropriate radio button for the ps data and midi data. If you tick
<b> from here </b>, then they are set in the frames <b>psoptions</b>
and <b>Voices</b> that described here.

<p>
The buttons <b>psoptions</b> and <b>Voices</b> allow
you to control how the music is rendered or played.
Clicking the <b>ps</b> button will show the following
window.
<p>
<img src = "psoptions.gif" alt = "psoption page">
<p>
Abc2svg recognizes all the formatting statements that are
listed on <a href="http://moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-doc/index.html">abcm2ps-doc page</a>. Some of these formatting parameters can be set by clicking
the <b>psoptions</b> button.
Enter the new values in one of entry boxes.
You can restore these values to their initial settings 
using the top button.
<p>
The values are saved in file called netheader.ini when you
exit the program and reloaded when you restart the program. The
netheader.ini is a plain text file that you can edit. For example,
you can insert other format parameters. Alternatively you can
delete some of the parameters using their default values.
<p>
Line-breaks in the abc notated file generate line-breaks in the
typeset score. If you check the box <b>ignore all line breaks</b>,
then the software will automatically place score line breaks.
This is useful for some files that contain only one measure per
line.
<p>
Certain midi indications in the abc file may cause problems
for the abc2svg JavaScript code. If you leave the <b>Include midi data</b> 
unchecked, all the %%MIDI instructions in the abc input will be
suppressed. All the voices will be assigned to the acoustic piano.
In order to be able to control the voice assignments
when you click the <b>Voices</b> button, then you should allow
midi data to be included.
<p> 
Many abc files do not assign MIDI program numbers (MIDI instruments)
to the voices. The <b>Voices</b> button allows you to do this
and set the loudness and direct the sound to either the left
or right speaker using the <b>pan</b> slider.
<p>
<img src = "voices.gif" alt = "midi voices">
<p>
If the tune does not have any voices,
then the MIDI programs, volume, and pan
associated with voice 0 apply to that tune.
The current version of the abc2svg library does not appear to
respond to these volume and pan controls.

<h3>Running netabc with local JavaScript Library</h3>
<p> Download the file 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/netabc/files/js.zip">js.zip </a>
 extract the
folder <b>js</b> from this archive and place it in the
same directory where netabc.tcl is located. Configure netabc
to <b>local js</b>. The library requires the following files
and folders as a minimum:
<pre>
abc2svg-1.js
abc2web-1.js
abc2web1-1.js
abc2web2-1.js
follow-1.js
MIDI-1.js
page-1.js
snd-1.js
and the folder Scc1t2
</pre>
<p>
The Scc1t2 directory contains all the instruments extracted from the
Scc1t2.sf2, font adapted by Microsoft from the Roland SC-55.

<h3> Limitations </h3>
<p>
Abc2svg will report various errors that it encounters in the
abc transcription but it presently does not indicate the
correct line number in the user interface. The user should
find other means (eg abcm2ps) for identifying and fixing these
problems.
<p>
Almost all desktop browsers come with development tools that
are useful for debugging web pages. Pressing the keys
cntl-shift-j brings up the console of this tool which may
be useful if something goes wrong. For example, the web page
may fail to find one of the JavaScript files.


<h3>Saving the sheet music to a pdf file</h3>

If your browser has a printer icon, click on this icon.
Otherwise, right click on the web page and hopefully there
should be an option to print.
